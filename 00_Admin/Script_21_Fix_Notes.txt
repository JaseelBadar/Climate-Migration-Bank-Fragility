SCRIPT 21 FIX - VIIRS DUPLICATE EXTRACTIONS
============================================
Date: 2026-01-15
Issue: Multipolygon districts extracted multiple times

DIAGNOSIS:
- GADM shapefile has 676 rows but only 659 unique districts
- 16 districts have 2-3 geometries (multipolygon features)
- Script 21 iterated over rows, not unique districts
- Result: Kinnaur extracted 3×, Bilaspur 2×, etc.

FIX REQUIRED:
Add dissolve step before extraction loop:

```python
# Line ~45 in Script 21, after loading GADM:
districts_gdf = gpd.read_file(gadm_path)
print(f"  ✓ Loaded: {len(districts_gdf)} rows")

# ADD THIS:
districts_gdf = districts_gdf.dissolve(by='NAME_2', as_index=False)
print(f"  ✓ After dissolve: {len(districts_gdf)} unique districts")
