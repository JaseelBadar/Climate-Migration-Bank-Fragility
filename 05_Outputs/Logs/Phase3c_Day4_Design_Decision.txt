PHASE 3c DAY 4: DESIGN DECISION LOG
Date: 2026-01-11
======================================================================

DECISION: Use GADM districts as panel skeleton (not RBI districts)

RATIONALE:
1. GADM is internationally standardized, version-controlled (v4.1), 
   and publicly reproducible
2. EM-DAT flood events reference geographic locations that map 
   naturally to GADM administrative boundaries
3. RBI district names can be matched TO GADM via crosswalk 
   (83.2% match rate achieved)
4. GADM provides spatial geometry for future GIS analysis

CONSEQUENCES:
- Panel has 666 GADM districts × 40 quarters = 26,640 rows
- RBI deposit data will be merged INTO this panel using 
  district_crosswalk_draft.csv
- 128 RBI districts (16.8%) will not match → will be dropped 
  or manually investigated in Phase 3d
- All exposure coding (Rule A/B) uses GADM district names as 
  the standard

ALTERNATIVE REJECTED:
Using RBI districts as skeleton would require reverse-mapping 
EM-DAT floods to RBI naming conventions, which is less 
reproducible and harder to validate.
